# Mentorskool Community Project - Understanding and Prediction of Soil Moisture using %Volume Water Content

-----------------
### Motivation of the project
**Agricultural and farming** sector Contributes ~17% to India's GDP. To yield better profits-using good quality seeds, managing irrigation are part of solution. One such answer to yield better profits is efficient understanding of soil moisture. Soil Moisture can help us manage irrigation, supply of nutrient to crop, quantifies soil fertility etc.

Soil Moisture can be measured with different types of sensors. But there are several disadvantage of using soil moisture sensor.To install a sensor, A person with agricultural expertise sould inspect soil for selecting sensor. Then a probe is to be installed. **Skilled Technician** is required to **collect data and maitain measurement process**. Quality and caliberation of sensors have to be maintained.

Several farmers cannot afford all of these tasks either due to financial constraints or lack of awareness. **%VWC is a measure of soil moisture**. An **ML solution** is to be built to **predict %VWC depending up on atmospheric conditions** so as to **avoid** all of this **hassle**. This although **doesnt completely avaoid the sensor measurement**, but **reduces the frequency** of measurement. 

-----------------
### Use Cases and Storyboards
As mentioned in the motivation we will develop and design a machine learning solution to reduce the frequency of measurement of soil moisture using sensors. This machine learning solution can help us answer several problems such as:

* **Impact of Atmospheric conditions on soil moisture:**
	*Understanding relationship among atmospheric conditions
	*Understanding relation between atmpospheric condition and soil moisture

* **Time Series analysis:**
	*How does soil moisture change w.r.t month
	*Seasonality analysis
	
and many more.....!!

-----------------
### Tasks Done
*Understanding how IoT devices are registered on cloud and collects data from the sensors
*Working with spark on databricks since the data will be of huge volume relative to academia(3.4 GB)
*Preparing Datasets suitable for the use-cases
*Working with Amazon S3 buckets
*Regular Data-Preprocessing and wrangling
*Extensive EDA with SQL and Python on databricks
*Design of Experiments with MLflow
*Statistical Analysis
*Visualizations on cloud using AWS quicksight
*Predictive modelling at scale on databricks using python
